\usage{
\method{plot}{many.sims}(file.list, grouping, snr.vec, method.nums = NULL,
  method.names = NULL, type = c("ave", "med"), std = TRUE,
  tuning = c("validation", "oracle"), bayes = TRUE, fig.dir = ".",
  file.name = NULL, w = 6, h = 6, mar = NULL, cols = 1:8,
  main = NULL, cex.main = 1.25, legend.pos = "bottomright")
}
\arguments{
\item{file.list}{vector of strings that point to saved sim objects (each
object produced by a call to \code{\link{sim.master}}).}

\item{grouping}{integer or factor vector indicating the grouping to use for
the simulations. Within each group, the relative test error achieved by
each method is plotted across the available SNR levels.}

\item{snr.vec}{Vector giving the SNR levels considered within each group.}

\item{method.nums}{the indices of the methods that should be plotted. Default
is NULL, in which case all methods are plotted.}

\item{method.names}{the names of the methods that should be plotted. Default
is NULL, in which case the names are extracted from the sim objects.}

\item{type}{Either "ave" or "med", indicating whether the average or median
of the relative test error metric should be displayed. Default is "ave".}

\item{std}{Should standard errors be displayed (in parantheses)? When type
is set to "med", the median absolute deviations are shown in place of the
standard errors. Default is TRUE.}

\item{tuning}{one of "validation" or "oracle", indicating whether the tuning
parameter for each method in each simulation setting should be chosen
according to minimizing validation error, or according to minimizing risk
on test set. Default is "validation".}

\item{fig.dir}{The figure directory to use. Default is ".".}

\item{file.name}{Vector of strings, giving the file names to use for the 
saved figures. Default is NULL, in which case the names "sim1", "sim2",
etc. are used. (Extensions of "pdf" are always appended to the given file
names.)}

\item{w, h}{the width and height (in inches) for the plots. Defaults are 6 and
6.}

\item{mar}{the margins to use for the plots. Default is NULL, in which case
the margins are set automatically (depending on whether not main is NULL).}

\item{cols, main, cex.main, legend.pos}{graphical parameters.}
}
\description{
Plot the results over several sets of simulations, where the same methods are
  run over different simulations settings.
